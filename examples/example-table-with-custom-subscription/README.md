For this task, it uses the custom subscription feature.
In general, it allows you to obtain data based on your custom rules which is not possible with the default functionality. You can read more about it in our [documentation](https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/contribution/widgets-development/#custom-subscriptions)

If you are looking for instructions on creating a custom widget, you should read the ```README``` file in ```example-table``` directory.
